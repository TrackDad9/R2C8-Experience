    <h2>About the Car</h2>
    <p>
      <b>2022 Corvette Stingray Z51</b> in Hypersonic Grey.<br>
      The 2022 C8 Corvette, Chevrolet's first mid-engine production sports car, delivers exhilarating performance with its 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the Z51 Performance Package. This powerhouse enables the C8 to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds, making it one of the fastest cars in its class. With its advanced dual-clutch 8-speed transmission, precise handling, and a top speed of nearly 194 mph, the C8 Corvette offers a thrilling driving experience that rivals many European exotics, all while maintaining the iconic American muscle car spirit.<br>
